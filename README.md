# System Capacity & Care Load Analytics for Unaccompanied Children

## Overview
This project develops a monitoring and analytics framework for tracking system capacity and care load across the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) program.

The analysis integrates daily operational data across:
- CBP custody intake and active load
- Transfers into HHS care
- HHS active care population
- Discharges to sponsors

The objective is to convert raw counts into actionable indicators for capacity planning, strain detection, and policy situational awareness.
